# Setting Up an Active Directory Home Lab

## Introduction
In this project, I set up a fully functional Active Directory environment using Oracle VirtualBox. By the end of this lab, I will have a domain controller and a client machine in a virtualized environment, which will help me understand Active Directory and Windows networking. The lab will include the following steps:

- Setting up the domain controller
- Configuring Active Directory Domain Services
- Creating user accounts using PowerShell
- Setting up the client machine
- Joining the client machine to the Active Directory domain
Steps to Set Up the Lab

## Step 1: Set Up the Domain Controller


## Step 2: Configure Active Directory Domain Services
This is a critical step in setting up the Active Directory environment. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the core component of Active Directory, providing the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators.

## Step 3: Create User Accounts

## Step 4: Set Up the Client Machine

## Step 5: Join the Client to the Domain
Joining the client machine to the Active Directory domain is essential for centralized management and authentication.

## Conclusion
In this project, I set up a basic Active Directory lab environment with a domain controller and a client machine using Oracle VirtualBox. This setup can be used to practice and understand various Active Directory and networking concepts.
