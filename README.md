#Setting Up an Active Directory Home Lab

##Introduction
In this project, I set up a fully functional Active Directory environment using Oracle VirtualBox. By the end of this lab, I will have a domain controller and a client machine in a virtualized environment, which will help me understand Active Directory and Windows networking. The lab will include the following steps:

- Setting up the domain controller
- Configuring Active Directory Domain Services
- Creating user accounts using PowerShell
- Setting up the client machine
- Joining the client machine to the Active Directory domain
